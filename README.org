* Org^2

Org-mode mobile client in React Native + Exponent, i.e. the ultimate productivity app for people who want to customize everything.

The goal is to provide a library for interacting with Org files along with a modular and extensible design for implementing different views into an Org tree.  Different views make sense for TODOs versus note-taking versus time tracking, and it is possible to create many different tools built on the same simple, extensible, and forever open format: plain-text org mode files!

At the moment, Org^2 is only tested on Android.

* Organization

Functions for interacting with org files are in the `org` directory.  This is primarily a parser written in pegjs, along with the data structure and utility functions.  It is implemented in immutablejs.

* Roadmap

This is a collection of planned and potential features.  The long term goal for the parser is to support every feature [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][of the Org Mode grammar]].  Once features are implemented in the backend Org library, it will be much easier to implement different applications in react.

+ Basic org features
  + [X] Priorities

  + Keywords
    + [X] TODO/DONE
    + [ ] Custom keywords
      + [ ] Global
      + [ ] Per file
  + [X] Scheduling (scheduled/deadline/closed)
  + [ ] Time tracking
  + [ ] Linking
  + [ ] Property drawers
    + e.g. effort
+ [ ] Export
  + Export back to .org file
    + Expect this to normalize org files, so export might not exactly match input if input doesn't match standard org format.
